# CloudWokery
Scripting for the GSQ OOST Upload Widget (CloudWok) to be cloned and embedded in Formstack forms.

Widget type:  HTML<br>

General note:  The code for this widget will be cloned across numerous separate CloudWoks<br>

Widget goals:  <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;-Include only two form fields that are both required<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Both equivalent to name and will be used with the subfolder workaround for Dropbox<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-No email or message form fields<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;-Show uploading files but do not show doanload-files list<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;-No success message popup<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;-No Terms of Service message<br>
 
Status:  I've been able to use the Widget Configurator to customize most of the above parameters.  However, I have been unable to limit the form fields to two names by removing the email and message fields.
